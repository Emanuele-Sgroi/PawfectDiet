## Introduction

Welcome to **Pawfect Diet**! This project is the culmination of my dissertation work for the BSc (Hons) Computer Science program at the University of West London. Pawfect Diet is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize canine nutrition management through AI-driven personalized solutions. 

Built using React Native Expo, Pawfect Diet leverages AI technologies for canine dietary recommendations and TensorFlow for breed recognition. This app aims to provide dog owners with precise, personalized dietary advice to enhance their pets' health and well-being.

Whether you're a new pet owner or a seasoned dog lover, Pawfect Diet offers a user-friendly experience enriched with features that adapt to your dog's unique needs.

**Note**: Pawfect Diet is currently in a test version, fully functional but still under active development. I am planning to continue enhancing the app by adding more features and improving the existing ones.
